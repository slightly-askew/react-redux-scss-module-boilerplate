# react-redux-scssmod-boiler
Redux, Jest, React-router, Hot Reload v3 beta, dev server, scss local modules, partial imports plus global stylesheet. Much owed to Wes Bos' awesome tutorial at https://learnredux.com/ but with scss support and css modules thrown in for good measure.

Installation

yarn install
yarn start

The production version (including webpack.config.prod.js file) is far from finished. I will update that at some point. Use this if you want a dev environment out of the boxt to have a play with. 

Test files included but very basic. Again, I'll update this into something a little more enlightening when I get there myself..
